# Game Theory in Mobile Privacy — Project Deliverable Proposal

This project recreates representative models from the four categories of privacy games identified in Wu et al. (2020).  
Each team member independently implements one game model, then we compile the results.

---

## Project Overview

- **OOG — Owner vs. Owner** - TBD
- **OCG — Owner vs. Collector** - Cameron
- **OAG — Owner vs. Adversary** - TBD
- **CAG — Collector vs. Adversary** - TBD

Each implementation becomes a case study in the final report, similar to the paper we are verifying.

## Deliverable Structure

The  following components:

### 1. **Model Overview**
- Short description of the game you implemented  
- Citation to the original paper that was recreated
- Explanation of why this game fits your assigned category

### 2. **Players**
Identify all players and their roles.

### 3. **Strategies**
List the available strategies for each player.

### 4. **Payoff Functions**
Provide the mathematical payoff or loss functions for each player.

### 5. **Equilibrium Concept**

State what solution concept you used:

- Best-response equilibrium  
- Pure Nash  
- Mixed Nash  
- Stackelberg equilibrium  
- Mechanism design optimum  

Explain briefly why this equilibrium concept fits your game.

### 6. **Implementation Details**

Include:

- A description of your computational approach  
- Libraries/tools used  
- Link or reference to your code file

---

### 7. **Results**

Provide:

- A figure or plot showing equilibrium behavior would be useful 
- Tables or matrices if relevant  
- Observations and trends  

---

### 8. **Interpretation**

A short paragraph summarizing:

- What this game teaches us about privacy  
- How the strategic incentives work  
- How your results relate to those discussed in the Wu survey paper

## **Final Report Structure**

The final deliverable will look something like this:

1. **Introduction (group-written)**  
2. **Common Analysis Framework (group-written)**  
3. **Case Study 1 — OOG**  
4. **Case Study 2 — OCG**  
5. **Case Study 3 — OAG**  
6. **Case Study 4 — CAG**  
7. **Cross-Case Comparison (group-written)**  
8. **Conclusion (group-written)**
